```

### Key Technologies
- **Go 1.21+** with WebAssembly compilation
- **go-app v9** framework for component-based UI
- **Service Worker** for offline capabilities
- **WebSocket** for real-time updates
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** for responsive layouts
- **Web App Manifest** for PWA installation

### PWA Features Implemented
- **Offline-first caching** with cache-first for static assets
- **Network-first for API** with offline fallbacks
- **Background sync** for score submissions
- **Install prompts** and app shortcuts
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile golf course use
- **Touch-friendly interface** with visual feedback

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- Modern web browser with WebAssembly support
- Backend API server (should run on :8080)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd /workspaces/golf_gamez/frontend

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start development server
make dev

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

### Build Commands
```bash
make build-dev    # Development build
make build        # Production build
make test         # Run tests
make lint         # Run linter
make clean        # Clean build artifacts
```

## 📱 Mobile Experience

The PWA is optimized for mobile golf course use:

- **Touch targets** minimum 44px for easy tapping with golf gloves
- **High contrast** design for outdoor visibility
- **Offline capability** for areas with poor cell coverage
- **Fast loading** with aggressive caching strategies
- **Install prompt** for native app-like experience
- **Pull-to-refresh** gesture support

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Code Changes**: Edit Go files in `cmd/` or `internal/`
2. **Auto-rebuild**: Use `make watch` for automatic rebuilds
3. **Testing**: Run `make test` for unit tests
4. **Linting**: Use `make lint` for code quality checks
5. **Build**: Use `make build` for production builds

## 🎯 Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. Complete Component Implementation
The foundation is solid, but the complex components need to be completed:

```bash
# The simplified components need to be expanded:
- Game creation and management
- Scorecard interface
- Leaderboard with side bets
- Real-time updates integration
```

### 2. Event Handler Pattern
Fix the go-app v9 event handling pattern:
```go
// Need to research the correct go-app v9 event handler signature
// Current issue: event handlers don't match expected interface
```

### 3. API Integration
Connect the frontend to the working backend:
```bash
# Backend should be running on :8080
# Frontend will proxy API calls automatically
```

### 4. WebSocket Implementation
Complete the real-time features:
```go
// WebSocket service is ready, needs integration with components
// Live score updates, leaderboard changes, etc.
```

## 🔍 Current Status

### ✅ Working
- PWA infrastructure (manifest, service worker, offline support)
- Build system and development workflow
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Basic Go WebAssembly application
